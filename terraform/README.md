# terraform

## Commands
[Terraform commands](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/index.html)
```
* terraform init - The *terraform init* command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.
* terraform plan - The *terraform plan* command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.
* terraform apply - The *terraform apply* command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a *terraform plan* execution plan.
* terraform destroy - The *terraform destroy* command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.
